# UI Branch
Current work on the UI can be found here. I do not garauntee that proper logic has been implemented for the totality of the project.

## Installation instructions
Notice that the `dist` folder is not included in this repo. To build the extension, `cd` into the folder and run `npm run build`; this will create the appropriate `dist` folder. You can now load the extension into Chrome by going to Settings > Extensions > Load Unpacked, then selecting the `dist` folder.
