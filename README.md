# Development Branch
Current development work on the project can be found here and will be updated as development progresses.

## Installation instructions
Notice that the `dist` folder is not included in this repo. To build the extension, `cd` into the folder and run `npm run build`; this will create the appropriate `dist` folder. You can now load the extension into Chrome by going to Settings > Extensions > Load Unpacked, then selecting the `dist` folder.
