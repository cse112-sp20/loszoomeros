# UI Branch
Current work on the UI can be found here. I do not garauntee that proper logic has been implemented for the totality of the project.

## Installation instructions
To install this Google Chrome extension, download and install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you are on Windows, open Powershell, otherwise open a terminal and `cd` into the project directory. Run `npm install` and then `npm run build` to install all dependencies and build the extension, respectively. You can now load the extension into Chrome by navigating to Settings > Extensions > Load Unpacked, then selecting the `dist` folder.
